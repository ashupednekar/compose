  subtitle: "Run Helm charts on Docker/Podman without Kubernetes. An open-source tool that lets you take Helm charts and run them directly on Docker or Podman, without needing a Kubernetes cluster. It bridges the gap between Kubernetes-native packaging (Helm) and traditional container runtimes (docker-compose.yaml), giving you the same artifacts and deployment flows across both worlds."
