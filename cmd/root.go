	Short: "Manage containers and artifacts in Docker or Podman environments",
	Long: `
Converts Helm chart artifacts (Deployments, ConfigMaps, StatefulSets, Ingress, etc.) into docker-compose YAML files and supporting configuration files.
It extracts containers, configs, ingress rules, volumes, and any environment interpolations from the Helm templates.
By default, it does not modify live deployments; it only generates artifacts locally for inspection, versioning, or later application using sync or apply.

This command is useful for clients who cannot run Helm/K8s directly and require a CD-like experience using docker-compose or podman-compose, while still leveraging the same upstream Helm artifacts.
